# Key Cmd Font

I created this to use for notes for lectures at BMCC and other places, using [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/).

For example, Save for Web in Photoshop:

There were a few others around but I wanted the negative space of the keys so I could change the color to match the design of various sites and look more like the keyboard (my Mac Air keyboard anyway).

I just used capital letters for non alpha-numeric characters, as follows:

A = alt option  
C = command  
V = control  
X = space  
R = return  
T = tab  
S = shift  
F = fn  
K = down arrow  
J = left arrow  
L = right arrow  
I = up arrow  
E = escape
